# Operating-System-Projects
Projects I did for CmpE 322 - Operating System course.

### MyShell
I implemented my own shell which is composed of a set of certain commands. The functionalities of these commands are already available within the default shell of your Linux-based OS. However, it is desired to implement a customized shell so that we can easily remember the commands and their corresponding functionalities.

### MultiThreading Project
I implemented a multi-threaded statistics calculator that used 1-5-10 threads (takes number of threads as parameter) for 10 different processes. It generates N integers from scratch and put them into an integer list. Then it calculates results of 10 operations (Harmonic Mean, Standard Deviation, Interquartile Range etc.).

### Fun Fair Payment Simulation
I implemented a multi-threaded application for simulating a fun fair payment system, where the customers can make the prepayments of the various rides through the available ticket vending machines. Since the prepayments can be made simultaneously through different ticket vending machine instances, I used mutex locks.
